**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[00:06]** Welcome to the SCRF Interviews Podcast and our first DeSci project highlights. Today, we have Patrick Joyce, Head of Operations, and Anton Lebed, the Community Lead, from Research Hub. Enjoy the interview.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[00:18]** Thank you for joining today. So Anton and Pat, would you mind just quickly introducing yourselves and we'll go from there?

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[00:24]** Sure. So, my name is Patrick Joyce. I'm one of the co-founders of Research Hub, I'm a long time science nerd. Started a PhD in molecular biology after college, left with masters, moved to a couple of years of medical school and ended up kind of seeing firsthand the issues that exist within the funding and publishing infrastructure for science. So I took a year off medical school and started a project where the idea was to create new incentives to help to encourage researchers to partake in healthy research behaviors when they publish. And so, I've been working on a DeSci project for really about five years now, have been collaborating on Research Hub for about two and a half years, which is where I met Anton.

**Anton Lebed:**

**[01:14]** Yeah, we actually met maybe two years ago, a friend of mine and me, I'm a PhD student, almost defending soon, so almost PhD; and we were starting another project, and we were kind of trying to get the lay of the land of the people in the open science start-ups, and that's where we met Patrick. And sharing a lot of the early ideas, and I think that has been the case with many early adopters of Research Hub, where they would discover that whatever they were doing at the time, Patrick was already doing it and was slightly ahead, so they decided to join that Research Hub instead. I believe Thomas, who is in the same boat, right?

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[02:03]** Yep. Yeah. He was working on another similar project. He's had to join forces instead.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[02:07]** Yeah, it's really cool. And I know I only  learned of Research Hub shamefully late, given the cool work that you have been doing for a few years now, but it would be interesting to hear kind of what some of those early days were like, how it got started and just what the beginning of the research hub journey was like.

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[02:25]** We've been on the Ethereum Mainnet since August of 2020 and had a MVP web app for maybe nine months before that. It's been a long journey, I'd say. I remember for probably like the first year and a half, I was at the top of the leaderboard, just from posting a paper once a day. And now we have a bunch of actual scientists who are at the top of the leaderboard, so it looks a lot better now.

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[02:52]** But yeah, I think it's been a lot of kind of grinding away and building relationships with people like Anton who, correct me if I'm wrong, Anton, but I'm not sure those early days of Research Hub were  giving  you a ton of utility personally as a scientist, who is more about like buying into a potential future state that could help to improve academia.

**Anton Lebed:**

**[03:14]** I mean, I think that's not unusual for the open science projects. I think the researchers kind of have this mindset that they have to be early adopters of stuff and projects just because because of the nature of open science projects, that they are a little bit of a slow burn type of thing where you can't immediately expect to have high utility, you have to invest and help the creators build it a little bit and then, maybe in the future, it will help you because whatever is the problem you're trying to solve.

**Anton Lebed:**

**[03:49]** But yeah, it was early days. It was all about getting in touch with more actual researchers. I think that's still their main goal because, utility wise, I think Research Hub is already pretty up there. It just needs a little bit of a push in terms of the community and the number of people who use it actively. It's one of those things where it's not enough to be just good enough, it also needs to be popular, somehow, magically.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[04:25]** Yeah, and I guess on that note, just to zoom in on the utility question kind of, how do you two view the value add of Research Hub to a scientist?

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[04:35]** So, for me personally, I think one of the craziest things in the industry, and I know a lot of people agree here, is that scientific publishers get to charge for publishing content, both from the content creators, the scientists, and the people consuming the content or whoever's paying for subscriptions on the backend. So, it's a really crazy business model where like the New York Times, for instance, pays for authors to create articles and then earns money on subscriptions from the investment that they made in those articles.

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[05:12]** While scientific journals they make money from the author and from the subscribers. So, one thing that research can do right now is essentially act as a preprint server, where scientists can share their manuscripts. And, while we don't have peer review or anything like that right now, we're hoping to get to the point where it's a viable option to publish a paper in Research Hub.

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[05:38]** And we want to create an industrial norm for the companies hosting this content to pay the authors for creating it. So, one of the nice things that we can do is help to compensate scientific authors with research coin for sharing their content under an open access license. So that way, anyone can learn from it.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[06:04]** Got it. So the main point of the token mechanism is to incentivize that more open access publishing.

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[06:11]** Yep. Healthy research behaviors in general. So one of the lowest hanging fruit there is sharing preprints, open access publishing; but then something we want to get into over time is like helping to break down the silos in science, help to have people be properly accredited for their research outputs that they share and create incentives where you can actually make more money, if me and Anton decide to collaborate on a project to necessarily work on them independently and hope to be the first one who can actually publish it.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[06:47]** I think the collaborative incentive alignment is something that's really exciting to see in Research Hub and in some other projects. And Anton, I wonder, especially when you were just getting into Research Hub, what was your view? Were you already in Web3? Were you already kind of excited for how this space can affect the scientific world? Or was this kind of: the first foray was that initial exploration and joining the organization eventually?

**Anton Lebed:**

**[07:11]** Oh, I wasn't into Web3 at all, and I think that's one of the big barriers for all the open science related projects in the DeSci space because most of the academics are pretty conservative in that regard; they don't exactly know how Web3 works. Some have certain prejudices towards it. So I would say it took me a while to realize what are the benefits of it.

**Anton Lebed:**

**[07:37]** If you really think about it, there are so many activities currently in the research process that are not highlighted and they're not rewarded, but they are required for the healthy development of a field right? So the peer review is rarely credited in any way. The discussions and generating ideas is not always credited. So that always happens behind the scenes:

**Anton Lebed:**

**[08:08**] you approach people with your research and you talk to them and they don't get enough contribution to be a co-author on your paper, but they have provided some input, so it would be nice to be able to reward them somehow in a systematic way. And that's why I think the Web3 is really good for that because it's, let's say fragmentary, in that regard, as in you can assign value to actions that you find healthy for the scientific process.

**Anton Lebed:**

**[08:41]** So right now we are experimenting with the D-work, with the custom goals. What kind of interactions you expect between researchers that you think are valuable enough to contribute  something that has actual monetary value? For example, if someone were to criticize your paper openly even after publication, that's an interaction that's very helpful for the community, but currently it's absolutely invisible and unrewarded in a systematic fashion, in the current paradigm, I guess; and that's something that could easily be fixed with a Web3 application.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[09:19]** I mean, I feel like we can go down a whole rabbit hole of just peer review related questions, but I'll save that for  a separate discussion. But I wonder, in terms of the process of initially growing the community, what were some of the  pain points? Was it kind of what you're alluding to with that reticence from the scientific community around Web3? What were sort of the pain points that you were experiencing initially?

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[09:45]** I think in general, academic science is a ridiculously competitive field. In the US biomedical sciences, it's something like 1% of first year PhD students end up being research professors. So, just the odds are really stacked against graduate students when it comes to like their chances of success at the career they want to have in theory, in academia. And so I think one of the biggest issues that we've come across is convincing early career scientists, that [one] this is worth their time, because in theory that's taking away from things they could be doing to progress their own career;

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[10:25]** and then [two] that it's not actually a career risk if you are to share a preprint or talk about your work in the open before it's actually published in a peer reviewed journal. A lot of people, I think, very reasonably are hesitant to do so because they perceive there's a risk of being scooped or have having basically like someone else come and run with their ideas faster than they can.

**Patrick Joyce**

**[10:48]** So yeah, I think in general there's like a reasonable hesitance towards tokens and Web3 and then also towards academic activities outside of the standard path towards having a academic research career.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[11:06]** And I wonder Anton, especially since you joined in and were contributing on the community growth side, were there any other elements that kind of came up, or is there a change of sort of what were the concerns in kind of two-ish years ago when you were just getting involved, versus how things look now?

**Anton Lebed:**

**[11:22]** I think one of the persistent concerns that was a big thing back in the day and still is, and I imagine that will be in the foreseeable future, is that academics are not really quite certain about the status of the IP, of the resources that they produce, who it belongs to, what they can share, what they can’t share? And when we invite people to contribute on Research Hub, one of the first questions they ask is: “Okay, so what if I share a paper? Am I the author of the paper? Can I share someone else's paper?” 

**Anton Lebed:**

**[12:00]** And for some people, it's not even an obvious question. They legitimately think that this is a portal where you can share only your own paper. And, I would say that that's not a specific concern for Research Hub, but also for just other platforms that require you to somehow deal with the intellectual rights for your publications.

**Anton Lebed:**

**[12:24]** Because it's so convoluted in a way; I don't know if it's purposefully convoluted or not; could be, right? But I think it's generally the case that whenever a person chooses a career where they have to be an absolute expert in one very narrow field, they kind of avoid getting into rabbit holes and other domains of their life.

**Anton Lebed:**

**[12:47]** And so many of the researchers I know have little to no idea about the IP status of their work that they submit to the publishers. And so they just try to avoid it, avoid ambiguous situations as they upload, and stuff, to Research Hub just in case. Maybe it's not that bad, but just in case, I wonder.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[13:14]** Yeah, of course. I mean, that's a big deal, and folks don't want to just rush into potentially jeopardizing years of work, so that's understandable. And, I guess, from the perspective of the kind of folks who you have been, the kind of scientists who have been joining Research Hub and actively engaging in the community, is there a sense of how many were already actively looking for some kind of more open solution and they just happened to come across Research Hub or, I don't know if there is a single typical user journey, but have you noticed kind of a trend or some trends of where these scientists are coming from?

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[13:51]** Yeah. So, demographic wise, I think it's a lot of late stage Ph.D. students and early career researchers, people who I think are disenchanted with the current state of academia and are looking for a way to contribute to making a positive change. When it comes to openness, I think, I would say like 75 to 80% of our most dedicated community members right now are very motivated by open science.

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[14:20]** Actually, the way that I got in touch with Anton was because his friend Nami hosted a open science journal club on GitHub, so I just saw that repo and is like, oh, these people are probably right up our alley. And I sent a cold email and now we're two years later here on a podcast. So yeah, I think the most compelling part of Research Hub currently, for like a totally new scientist who stumbles across us, is that we can help to accelerate the adoption of the open scientific culture, and I think it's a big reason why a lot of people are spending their time now trying to help us grow.

**Anton Lebed:**

**[15:02]** In my experience, it's either easier the people are Web3 followers or the open science advocates, and there is a little bit of overlap, but I don't think it's so big, honestly.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[15:16]** Yeah, and I wonder I mean, I feel like the gap between those two is unfortunately large. Do you feel like it's narrowing it all or does it feel just as large as it was two years ago or if not even larger, given the amount of noise coming out of the Wed3 space in the last year or so?

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[15:31]** I think it's definitely narrowing. I think people are starting to recognize the tools within Web3 as the tools that can help fix a lot of the problems in science. We're close with the Center for Open Science, which makes a product called Open Science Framework, which is a place where scientists can share like all of the data around their projects and also preprints and we've been in discussions with them to potentially use tokens to help to incentivize, not quite peer review, but author attestations that they have.

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[16:08]** For instance, when someone publishes a preprint on the open science framework, they can offer to claim whether they have open data associated with the manuscript, or if there was a pre-registration associated with it. And so, Center for Open Science essentially wants to help incentivize random people to fact check these authors. So if someone claims that they have open data, they would reward a random person with tokens for double checking to make sure that that paper does actually have open data.

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[16:40]** So, I think some of the kind of bigger established players in the open science field are excited by what's happening in the Web3 community and see it as like a potential fix for some of the issues that happen now, where scientists are hesitant to fully participate in these open scientific behaviors just because it doesn't really make sense for them personally, incentive wise.

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[17:06]**  They're not dogmatic about open science, and they'd rather prioritize their own career. So, using tokens to help to encourage these behaviors is a great way to actually get the average person to have it make sense for them to share openly and collaborate with people across the world, kind of similarly to how open science frameworks facilitates those types of interactions.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[17:31]** Yeah, and I wonder, Anton, when you were kind of on the journey of getting involved in Research Hub, was that already part of a big kind of push on your end as someone who was just exploring and kind of doing their PhD of what are more open options for publishing in research communities? Or do you mind sharing a little bit of kind of what got you excited in looking in the open science direction in the first place?

**Anton Lebed:**

**[17:54]** Yeah, 100%. Honestly, my department, I would say, is a pretty, let’s say, advanced in terms of open science practices and psychology, in general, because if you are familiar with the reproducibility crisis, it has been burned by the lack of openness and transparency. So a lot of the open science initiatives stem from psychology now, just because we know we have so much demand for it.

**Anton Lebed:**

**[18:21]** And so, yeah, definitely, I was already kind of trained to look for open science solutions. I wouldn't say I expected developments to come from the Web3 world. I think that still needs more examples for people to learn that Web3 can be used in that fashion. Reminds me of this recent case where a researcher crowdsourced one of the tokens to get some of their processing time on the supercomputer for his quantum research, or something like that, Patrick do you remember this one?

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[18:57]** Yeah, it was through mirror. He did a mirror blog and raised, I think like 4 ETH or something in order yet to get like quantum compute time. 

**Anton Lebed:**

**[19:05]** Now, I wonder, I mean, honestly, I think the easiest and most obvious use case for the Web3, or for any tokens  in open science, would be some form of crowdsourcing. But I guess that's not a very unique feature that you could crowdsource, which is you know, the traditional currencies. So I wonder if one of the newer tokens will have some specific functionality and how is distributed that will be tailored for open science. But I struggle to see it at the moment.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[19:45]** I guess on on the general note of open science, were there any other kind of inspirations for either one of you were just projects that got you excited, either when you were just getting started into this direction or now that you're so deeply involved in building and supporting Research Hub?

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[20:02]** So I have a couple, I think maybe non-traditional answer - Reddit. There are a lot of subreddits that are just incredibly powerful where it's like super concentrated experts in a subfield of science where you can learn a lot. Like our psychiatry personally, when I was in medical school, our medical student was unbelievably helpful. So, I think Reddit in general is a great example of experts crowdsourcing opinions.

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[20:30]** Another one, which I'm a huge fan of is, lame to say, but GitHub. There is one of my favorite scientists that I've met through working on DeSci projects. Worked for a lab at UPenn called the Green Lab, and so when COVID first hit, this lab is like very technologically advanced and is very motivated by open science.

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[20:56]** And so they just started reviewing every preprint openly on a GitHub repo, that would come out about COVID. Just a bunch of scientists together saying, “Hey, we're all reading these papers, might as well share our thoughts in the open, you know, under a CC license, that way anyone can learn from it.” So that's the green lab on GitHub,

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[21:13]** has awesome manuscript for reviews. And then the last one, which I find very inspiring, is by a psychologist in the Netherlands named Dr. Chris Hartgerink called Liberate Science. I think it's Research Equals is the name of the project. But the idea here is to try and dismantle the scientific paper as the standard unit of communication for science.

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[21:42]** And so, he's created like a distributed database where scientists can share micro publications or a little tiny bits of research, in the open, in order to prevent publication delays. So, when information is created, it's immediately shared and anyone can build on top of it by citing those tiny micro publications. So Research Equals is also another kind of Web3 project that I think is very inspiring.

**Anton Lebed:**

**[22:14]** Yeah, also a big fan of Research Equals. And honestly, it just in general, that's very much the case for me and many other researchers that you're sitting on a ton of unfinished work, right? As in data that are not exciting enough to maybe publish as a standalone article, but still useful for someone but even, you know, not valuable enough for you to write an intro and conclusions for. So, I'm a big proponent of  Research Equals and, in general, for other outlets and signs that people should be able to share other types of output.

**Anton Lebed:**

**[22:57]** They should be able to share just databases and let it be their recognized type of citation. They should be able to share it just the introduction, just you know, teasing the hypothesis without actually doing anything more that would be good enough. That would be an interesting thing to read and tease your brain before you go and do your own research, and just other type of media, a video. Looking forward to the world in which you could actually include a video in your CV as a respectable line, right? Dance your dissertation . . .

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[23:34]** The multi multi-modal papers are going to be very exciting. What are you hopeful for in terms of DeSci and open science in general going forward?

**Anton Lebed:**

**[23:44]** Well, it would be really nice if the traditional academia will get a little bit more in touch with the Web3, in general, just because right now there is an unhealthy divide, I would say, that people don't really recognize the functionality as much as they should. And yeah, I just hope for more openness on all fronts, including the one that I just highlighted for it; to consider what could be a publication,

**Anton Lebed:**

**[24:16]** so we could revise all that tradition that we currently have and maybe reconsider which ones are a little bit outdated perhaps, and don't need to be like this. For example, the traditional publishing system that in which somehow in the world where as a majority of the journals are not even paperback anymore, and somehow you get charged more for colored graphs in your article as if it will require ink to  print it. ** **Yeah, so stuff like that would be nice to get rid of and maybe, actually,

**Anton Lebed:**

**[24:57]** slight shift in understanding of the intellectual property of the represented by the articles. I know Patrick, and the rest of the team, we talked about NFT’s  a little bit and I'm actually looking forward to the world in which the offer will have an actual tangible ownership of the paper, perhaps in form of token, so they're free to sell or hold or whatever else they want to do with them.

**Anton Lebed:**

**[25:26]** But I think that just being able to conceptualize and visualize this talk and this will perhaps do good for people's understanding of what they actually own and have rights for. I think that will be really healthy for science in general.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[25:45]** Absolutely. And I feel like anyone who is paying attention to the decentralized portion of the open science portion gets very excited by truly making it more accessible. So, yeah, Patrick, I would want to ask you the same thing as sort of what are your sort of hopes and elements that get you most excited going forward?

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[26:03]** I think it's like two part in my view. One is accelerating open science - I think it's something like 30% of papers right now are published openly and it's an exponential curve. So it's looking good for adoption. But I think having like the financial stability portion, that can come with a Web3 token, will really help to make it make sense to the average scientist to participate in these open science behaviors.

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[26:34]** So, that's one piece that I'm excited for is added incentive for open publishing, open discussion. Another piece is, kind of, breaking down the ivory tower of academia. So, one thing that I love about GitHub is - anyone can use it. Software engineering in general, you're only limited by your access to the Internet. If you can learn from open source projects, write your own code, get feedback from other people online, and you can become a pretty talented developer really anywhere in the world,

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[27:10]** and there's not a lot of geographical barriers to stop you from doing that. Academia is not like that. You need to be in a tier one research institution in order to have the resources that are required in order to produce extremely high quality academic knowledge. And one thing that I think Web3 will really unlock is the ability to have it make financial sense for anyone in the world to spend their time learning from and contributing to science.

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[27:42]** So, maybe you're not born in London or Germany or Massachusetts or California, but if you can get online and earn a couple bucks an hour for reading papers and being curious; over time, that effort can snowball into extremely valuable contributions. So I think Web3 is going to drastically increase the number of people who see themselves as scientists and to essentially create a viable opportunity for these people to earn a little bit of money and make it sustainable for them to learn and contribute to academia.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[28:22]** That's great. And I also just wanted to quickly double check; in terms of Web3 usage on the Research Hub side, are there any other kind of Web3 tools beyond token incentivization for the Open Access Publishing? Are there any other elements that you would say are kind of incorporating Web3 tools at the moment?

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[28:40]** In theory, research coin is a governance token, so we do use it for some governance decisions. For instance, what is the structure of our hubs? We recently had our first governance vote where essentially the community got together and created a proposal about how our hubs would be structured. And so, yeah, the vote passed and we're implementing it currently. In addition, we have researched coin budgets for the community, in order to allocate to do all kinds of different things, like maybe participate in DeFi protocols, like help to fund different researchers. So, community decision making, I think is also kind of powerful. In the future we plan on implementing things like Arweave to help with decentralized storage of the content created on Research Hub.

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[29:37]** But yeah, right now Research Hub is essentially is like a Web2 app that has a token component where people can withdraw their research coin earnings on the website to ethereum and then participate in the ethereum infrastructure and use those tokens for voting decisions in the community.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[29:57]** That's great. Thank you for clarifying that. And I guess just as we're coming to a close, I want to just give both of you a chance to either mention anything in particular, whether it's milestones on Research Hub or or personal kind of projects in the science direction and where people can learn more about Research Hub.

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[30:13]** Yeah, definitely. So what I'm really excited for is the past couple of months of the editor  program, like we like to call it. Essentially we have PhDs and Masters in a bunch of different fields who are essentially caretaking individual hubs. For instance, Anton's one of the editors of the psychology hub. And we have just under 100 weekly active users of Masters and PhDs who are helping to take care of these individual hubs. So, I think the content on Research Hub has gotten a lot more exciting over the past couple of months. And so we're hoping that we'll be able to scale into the future. Yeah, that's what I'm most excited for.

**Anton Lebed:**

**[31:00]** Yeah, I personally am excited for something that's almost inevitable, that's why I'm pretty optimistic. As the number of people using Research Hub increases, I expect more and more meaningful interactions between users. Some of the more amazing moments in academia and the reason I am in academia, are happening outside of the rooms and lecture halls where I talk to excited people about the research and the small conversations where I learn something or share something; they just make my blood flow. And that's the type of interactions I think will become more and more common on Research Hub.

**Anton Lebed:**

**[31:42]** In fact, I am expecting, within a year, to use a Research Hub for my dopamine kick of that day to get there and have a quick chat with some of the excited individuals. It doesn't matter if they are, you know, experts in the field or they're just curious, it’s rewarding either way. And yeah, that's pretty much it. All the other good stuff with incentivization for me is just an added bonus to all the cool and exciting interactions that I'm hoping to get in the future and getting out.

**Eugene Leventhal:**

**[32:16]** Yeah, it's exciting to think how powerful that community component is. But yeah, I really appreciate both of you joining the conversation today and giving a glimpse into some of the background of Research Hub and how you got here. We’ll make sure to include links to Research Hub itself and the Twitter and all that and any other relevant socials, and I'll follow up with you offline too to make sure we capture all that information. But just thank you again for joining us today.

**Patrick Joyce:**

**[32:41]** Thanks for having us Eugene. And thanks for organizing all of this community building in the DeSci space. I’m really excited to see where this goes next year.

**Anton Lebed:**

**[32:49]** Yeah. Thank you. It was a pleasant conversation.
