**James McGirk:**

**[00:05]** Welcome to another episode of Smart Contract Research Forum Interviews. I'm your host, James McGirk, filling in for Eugene Leventhal. In this episode, we'll be discussing the intersection of art research and Web3 with Eric Barry Drasin. Eric, would you like to introduce yourself?

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[00:21]** Hello, Smart Contract Research Forum, I'm Eric Barry Drasin. I'm primarily a media artist and researcher. My background is at the intersection of real time media, art, and performance. I work across a number of different areas. I'm in a Ph.D. program at the University of Colorado, Boulder in Media Studies. I have a sort of conceptual art performance project called DungeonMaster.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[00:51]** I also work as a research strategist with startups, and I've been recently working with… like… kind of more in the augmented reality space, and I have been working in the blockchain space since early, like late 2015 or early 2016. And I did it before I did my MFA at the University of Buffalo in Emerging Practices, where I created a thesis exhibition called _Exit Strategy_, in which I was really exploring a lot of these ideas at the intersection of web3, emerging sociality and conceptual art.

**James McGirk:**

**[01:35]** And as for me, James McGirk, I'm an editor at SCRF and an author and multimedia artist. So before we start talking about the Distributed Art Object Framework, DAOF, some of us, some of our listeners might not have been exposed to the idea of research or philosophy being part of the artistic practice. So, I was wondering, do you mind sketching out some of the history of conceptual art and maybe then kind of discussing the role of contracts and questions of value in art?

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[02:05]** Sure. So, when… When I talk about this, I try to paint a very simplistic picture because it can be really complicated. And there's, you know, there's a lot of nuance and different movements, but basically, we're talking about a sort of a point around the middle of the 20th century when artists started getting frustrated with the limitations of two-dimensional representation on the canvas.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[02:31]** So paintings and tradition, like what people think about when they think about fine art, they think about paintings, they think about maybe sculpture. But artists started feeling frustrated. It felt like a lot of the ideas had been sort of exhausted. So, we start seeing this process, which art historians call the dematerialization of the art object. And what this did was blow open the entire frame for what art could be.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[03:02]** And all of a sudden, _art become performance_. When electronic media started to be more prominent and the cost of using electronic media devices like video… videography equipment became more affordable. Artists started using that. And they started exploring, ‘well, okay, what is this?’ ‘What… What are the formal properties of this medium?’ And so all these ideas and history and context that had been previously applied to two dimensional representation in painting and then photography and then sculpture….

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[03:39]** What is it to use a medium right? What is it? What does it mean to use steel or what does it mean to use iron and weld something or like sculpt something out of clay? What are these properties of the medium mean? Those ideas started getting applied to television, like what is a communication infrastructure? What is this box sitting in my living room?

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[03:59]** What happens when I start messing with the circuits and make it do weird things that it wasn't intended to do? And they start treating electricity as a medium, as a sculptural medium. And so, well, there's a few examples that I'm going to bring in. But the easiest one is to talk about is Sol Lewitt who was a graphic visual artist who started making visual works that consisted of sets of instructions.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[04:33]** Lots of people will talk about him like he was the first generative artist because his works were just sets of instructions for how other people could realize his work. And so he would make these big, great gradient type paintings and his assistants would just go to the place where the work was commissioned and they would adapt to whatever wall it was being commissioned to do on, which is very similar to how media artists work now with projection and with screens or, you know, we can kind of adapt to any surface.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[05:07]** And so he was doing this in the early 1950s. And so his works started becoming… became dematerial. It became a set of instructions. It became code. And so when artists started pushing beyond art objects and making works that were like, well, what if, what if it's just like an idea? What if I instigate a social process? What if I critique the institution of art itself? You know, the museum? 

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[05:35]** What if I write a document that just outlines an idea for a potential piece that can maybe never be realized? What happens if I go into the New Mexico desert and make some giant, like, sculpture out of dirt? You know, what does that mean for me to do that? And so all these other ideas started finding this intersection at what we call art.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[06:02]** But the whole system had to then wake up and adapt to these new modalities that were resisting the traditional capitalist infrastructure of buying and selling objects. And so this is where we start talking about contracts. But maybe I'm getting a little ahead of myself here.

**James McGirk:**

**[06:20]** No, I think that's no, I think you're setting it up perfectly. I guess, you know, the next question I have is, what is the Distributed Art Object Framework? But, you know, it would be really interesting to hear a little bit more about the history of contracts in art and especially with media art and how that informed the piece.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[06:40]** So, there's something that was created in the early seventies called the Artists Reserved rights and Transfer Agreement. It was made by this kind of conceptual artist and curator Seth Siegelaub and a lawyer named Robert Projansky. And basically, the whole concept of this was to create a contract, a very easily replicable contract that can mediate the sale and resale of artworks protecting the rights of artists that were making these dematerialized artworks.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[07:07]** So, you had people like Hans Haacke, who's a famous conceptual institutional critique artist. He was working with cybernetics. I mean, a really incredible person, a big influence of mine who had a big retrospective in the New Museum right before the pandemic started. But he was using this contract to mediate the sale and the rights of all of his works.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[07:31]** And this was based on an earlier sort of court case in the United States where Robert Rauschenberg was trying to protect the resale of his work, because he he had works that he sold for like nothing that were then being resold 10, 15 years later for like astronomical amounts of money at the time.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[07:53]** And he's like, I'm living in poverty. People, like what's going on? And it just… this was something that was very difficult to execute in the United States. In Europe, they apparently have this law that will protect artists, you know, and there's just a much more robust, I think, labor protection in Europe than there is in the United States.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[08:17]** So you had artists experimenting with contracts and conceptual art, starting in the very, very early stages of the modern art period. The example that I go to that's considered the sort of seminal piece was a piece by Marcel Duchamp in 1925 called the _Monte Carlo Bond_, where he basically was making fun of hanging out at Monte Carlo and gambling.

 **Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[08:43]** And he created a speculative bond for his…his investors to invest or his collectors, I guess, to invest in his art enterprise. He had Man Ray like put this photo of him with like his face covered in shaving cream with like his hair and double horns in cream but a was a bond. But like the ones that were numbered and had his artist signature on them were the only valid bonds.

 **Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[09:21]** Yeah. This is like on the Christie's website. The other example that I really like is Yves Klein. Basically, he issued contract statements, right? These were these certificates of authenticity. That were for an allotment of empty space. And they were sold by the gallerist to collectors. And the collector had two options. They could retain the certificate.

 **Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[09:52]** But if they wanted to actually authenticate the artwork and execute it, they had to dump a certain amount of gold in the Seine River while a gallerist and a lawyer watched. And so he was basically playing with a contractually mediated transaction space as a conceptual artwork. And so I love this artwork because it was a huge influence on my thinking about contracts as mediated sociality and as a relational art form.

 **Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[10:25]** And so back in 2017 this Canadian artist named Mitchell Chan encoded this piece onto the Ethereum blockchain. And this is before NFTs that he did this. It was a really brilliant piece, also a big influence on my work. You know, when I saw that, I was like, well, mind blown. This is… this is basically one of the best blockchain art and only good blockchain art pieces out there.

 **Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[10:50]** So there's this history of people working with contracts as a medium of making conceptual artworks that are playing with a type of relational space. Then there's other parts of this, right, outside of just like how do we define an artwork? Well, the artwork basically becomes something which is encoded into a contract, right? Like one of the important questions for people working in contemporary art is what is the actual art, for instance?

 **Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[11:24]** Well, let’s say I'm a video artist. And I make experimental video art in like the early 1980s. So, there's a couple of places that you could say like, well, this is the actual art for some artists. They created video synthesizers and they have walls of circuits, right? They were using machines to process images. And for some of those artists, they'll say, well, this, my machine is the art.

 **Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[11:48]** And then other artists who maybe go and use those machines would say, “Well, the art is the video recording that I recorded on this specific three-quarter inch tape deck.” And that video tape on that three-quarter inch tape, that's the art. Others will say, “Oh, it's just the recorded image. So it's cool. Yeah, digitize it.”

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[12:08]** It's all right because it's just the representation of the outside electrical process. Others will say, oh, but I recorded myself performing on the camera and then processed it through that system. So actually, the art for the art object in this case is the performance. So you have four different artists with four divergent notions of what their art is. But it's all video art. 

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[12:28]** And so you have to account for that in the contract, basically stating for curators, for archivists. All right. You want to mount this in an exhibition 30 years after the artist died. What is the work? What is the piece you know? Well, I mean, there's a story that I heard which just may be unfounded.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[12:50]** I don't remember this exactly, but it's a good example of this idea, they were doing a retrospective of Mike Kelley at L.A.C.M.A, maybe. And like, he had some like objects, like painted boards that were painted white. And he was projecting on them, and they went crazy trying to find the exact color white that he used in this installation, you know, in the eighties or whatever.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[13:13]** Anyway, they go talk to his friend who is this other famous artist and he was like, “No, the piece isn't that specific color white. It's whatever white was at the local hardware store.” Yeah, that's a big difference. Like, that's the piece, the piece is whatever was around, he just used whatever he had, you know, and like you’re going and manufacturing this specific shade of white in China, it doesn't actually make it more of the piece than going and buying whatever happens to be at the Ace Hardware down the street, you know?

**James McGirk:**

**[13:40]** Yeah, I remember hearing that with Dan Flavin and, you know, replacing the fluorescent tubes, and everything and having to specially source them but it was totally against what the art was supposed to be, which was just kind of grabbing them at the, you know, at the whatever the Home Depot equivalent was in 1968 or something.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[13:57]** Well, right. And I was just talking with someone about this, actually. Where was the. Oh, I was in Santa Fe. There is this fantastic new media got archival gallery where they have a collector and they said they've archived all these seminal new media artworks starting in the early 1970s. And I went there and Deborah Birnbaum was up there and they had a Gary Hill piece.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[14:23]** And now the thing was that the exhibition director was talking to me and she said, “Oh yeah, we had a Dan Flavin and like this museum spent like you know, a ton of money buying this Dan Flavin. And the piece kind of stipulated like, yeah, like once the light bulb, once the neon dies, that's it. It's over Yeah.”

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[14:44]** But they so they basically had to go to his estate and say, yo, like, look, we can manufacture something that's really, really, really, really close to this thing? And we just spent like billions of dollars on this piece. You have to let us just like, you know, replace the bulb with this thing. We're having it custom manufactured, you know, and they said, yes, because it's like in reality, it's like you can't really let the piece die like that.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[15:10]** You know, it's… it's unfair, but that is an interesting thing ….in theory, artists have the right to revoke the title to their artwork. Right? We can negate the artwork and say, that is not my work anymore. Which separates art from lots of other objects. Assets… like you can't issue a bond for your business or a stock and then say, oh, yeah, that's not actually my stock.

**James McGirk:**

**[15:43]** Well, that's really interesting. So I guess this is sort of what the art object in the distributed art object framework is, essentially. And so like… what is it that you created from this? So, how did your work use web3 technology to kind of create this framework? And what is the framework, how does it sort of help artists or is planning to help artists?

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[16:07]** Well, so before I launch into that, I should maybe talk a little bit about how I got there. So I guess, in terms of thinking about art in this way. My background was in creating interactive video art. One of my primary mentors and influences was an artist who, you know, named Benton C. Bainbridge, who's a very well-known New York media artist.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[16:38]** And so for the last well, over ten years now, it's almost 15 years I've been doing interactive video performance. And I was really involved in trying to organize community spaces for this type of work to happen in New York, where I was located for many years. And so I was both performing you know, using sort of custom software instruments that generate sound and video. And then I was also curating and organizing shows and exhibition rooms and festivals to create spaces for this work, to be contextualized within the specific framework and lineage and history of experimental video art, right? Like understanding. Yes. There's a historicity, there are artists that came before us that have been doing it. There's institutions that have been supporting us.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[17:32]** And we want to make sure that our work was being presented in dialogue with that stuff, as opposed to some of the more commercial applications of this technology. Like making exhibitions for advertising agencies and stuff like that. So I'm just going to show 30 seconds of a video that I was of a previous performance sequence.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[17:56]** So this is called _Head Games_. I'd created like a feedback system between my body, a head mounted camera and the screen. I'm using wireless sensors on my hands to control and mediate the feedback, right between these sort of three points of recursion. And the video is being sent into a computer which is mapping the image across these three walls. And the video is also being sent into another piece of software that's generating sound. So you're actually hearing what's being generated on the screen because the video is being basically compressed into an audio buffer which is being fed into a 60-cycle square wave oscillator. Yeah. And so I thought this program, this is the last kind of piece that I was showing before the pandemic started.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[18:47]** And I was this is basically yeah; this is my project. It's called Diggers And this particular piece was called Head Games. So, I was doing this. And in late 2015 Benton, who, you know, I've been working with forever, started talking to me about like, yo, I've been talking to these really heavy people who are into this blockchain stuff and like Bitcoin, I'm like, Oh yeah. And so he basically started teaching me about it. And he's like, I want to watch this project.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[19:19]** And I'm like, okay, yeah, I'm super down to help you. And so we started launching a project called Moving Pictures Gallery, which the concept is: way before NFTs were a thing, basically what we were doing is trying to take work, like what I was just showing you, which is performed in real time and happens with a generative process.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[19:43]** It happens singularly in time and space. I can perform this piece dozens of times, but it's different every time I'm, you know, I'm, I'm in relationship, I'm in dialog with the machine. And so there's a whole community of artists globally that do this type of work. That's an extension of what was happening in the seventies and eighties.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[20:06]** But now we have more powerful computers and more knowledge that's evenly distributed about how to hack gear and make this stuff. So we're like, all right, well, let's make a process whereby we can sort of tie this concept of this performative gesture, which happens singularly in time and space to a cryptographic gesture, which is also singular in time and space and, in addition, performance,

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[20:33]** as a type of currency. And it was an experimental idea, and I thought at the time it was a really good idea because real time media, up until actually like, I honestly feel like it's changing in the last year and a half, but two years. But, you know, this type of work wasn't didn't have widespread acceptance,

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[20:52]** and it was very difficult to present this work and find institutional support for this work. So, I thought like, wow, this is cool. We can, like, support all our friends and create a platform that will allow for them to both archive their work. It'll gain some type of legitimacy and they can make some money off of these performances.


**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[21:13]** Which is basically we're all living on peanuts at this point. And so, we start this process; we're working on it; we were working with some of the original and some early Ethereum people who were really interesting guys, but it ultimately didn't end up working out with them. And at that point, we kind of let go of the project because we had been working on it for many months.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[21:37]** We realized that we didn't want to start a business, which was what we were starting to see we were being pushed towards by the various people that we were looking to, to try and fund this process. I think, at the time, Benton and I were thinking about this as a kind of open-sourced commons project.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[21:57]** That was going to create a platform, but maybe we would eventually make some money from it, but we wouldn't do that at the expense of our community. This was fundamentally, at its core, a community toolkit, and it needed to be an open-source project. But, after talking with a lot of these blockchain folks, and the venture capitalists in New York, we we quickly realized, that these guys want a business plan and they want to know how they're going to sell us out in three to five years.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[22:24]** I think that made us both very uncomfortable. So at that point, we kind of shelved the project. So this is, you know, mid to late 2016. When we were working on this. But, at the time, I became very interested in this idea of contractual mediation. And I thought, like, wow, like, all right, there's a lot of really interesting stuff that we can do with this beyond just creating a platform for this very one specific type of art.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[22:57]** I wonder, like, what else could this be; are there historical precedents that I could follow? Like, is there a way? Because like Benton was always talking about: “Eric, this is programable currency.” We can literally, literally just create an economy from scratch. And me being a student of political economy, and that's something I like and am very interested in, like, wow, we can program an economy from scratch.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[23:24]** What does that even mean? I don't know. But that's really interesting. And, can we encode better stuff, better behaviors, better attitudes, better fundamental ideologies Into how this these systems sort of emerge? And so, after that, I went to grad school in 2017 at the University of Buffalo, and I started really diving into some of these issues.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[23:51]** So, in the beginning, I was not working on the distributed art object framework. It was kind of in the back of my mind, but I didn't want to take the time to articulate what we had been working on because I was sort of trying to sort of push towards some other ideas. So, this was an early piece called the Distributed Autonomous Katamari.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[24:12]** It was just a speculative piece but basically the idea is that we issue these tokens and this is actually, wow, this is like an old piece. I don't actually remember all the aspects of it. The Katamari Damacy is a video game where you have this kind of ball that rolls over the planet Earth because the king of the world is trying to patch a hole and heaven and so your video game character is just this infinitely accumulating ball of desire that just is sucking all things into it.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[24:43]** So I started thinking about like some of the environmental, ecological and, sort of, ideological issues that were surrounding blockchain. So basically, we have Chinese server farms here which are powering the Ethereum blockchain. And basically, you have these tokens and they I think they have to be speculated on. So, like the idea is that all the fractional owners of this artwork and this is like a, this is a 2017 piece.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[25:14]** The fractional; so I was thinking about fractional ownership and like collectivity and how the collectors basically have to constantly keep over speculating each other in order for the piece to exist and if it's the same price they get, their value gets revoked. But if it goes up then the piece keeps living. And so the tokens are encoded to require circulation or they're nullified.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[25:38]** The tokens have to trade among themselves or speculate on their shares in the open market, once a token has been traded at a higher value, that value is now assigned to that token indefinitely. So basically this was like before we were really talking about bonding curves, but this piece was kind of intuiting the concept of a… of a bonding curve applied to a work of art.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[26:01]** So the second part of it was basically so we have smart contracts here and we are HODL-ing, we have 100 ERC-20 tokens and we have just like a firewall. So then in the second diagram, this is where it gets interesting. So basically we have the Katamari coin value accumulation. Which gives it more buying power. And so basically the contract then hires humans to build server farms and, through pattern detection, machine learning and computational power, exponential power increase, we have an automated speculation engine which is built by humans for the Katamari.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[26:43]** And basically through investments in real estate, stock market and Crypto-Kitties, they just have exponential value increase. And so they start buying lofts in Bushwick, Brooklyn, which is like it was a, you know, an area of Brooklyn that I used to live where the artists used to live, and they start speculating on student art school debt, you know, and these are all very good investments.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[27:08]** So the idea is like there's this like this sort of exponential value and computation increase. Then once it reaches kind of this crescendo, it reaches AI Weiwei, and we now have AI Weiwei. We we're just like we're an artificial art conceptual art object. And then it basically starts collecting abstract paintings and selling abstract paintings at an auction.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[27:35]** And so once it purchases a Frank Stella who's kind of the seminal modern male modernist artist. And by the way, it's only selling male painting, abstract paintings from dead white male artists, you know? And so it speculates on these dead white male artist paintings. And then with a purchase of Frank Stella, who's still alive,

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[27:55]** but, you know, he's kind of the seminal, self-reflexive, the frame feeding back on itself. High modern artist, right? We unleash a swarm of Twitter bots that starts hyping all these artists. And at that point, we've reached a maximum self reflexivity and we achieve sentience. So then, once we achieve conceptual art, self-reflexive sentience, we start producing works ourselves in the style of dead white male artists.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[28:28]** And we achieve early success in our career by gathering 70,000 Instagram followers, and we start producing art in the likeness of itself. And so we, of course, hire interns; and through maximum reflexivity and indifference, we climb the Singularity Phallus; and then we achieve art world singularity. And at that point, we just; there's an implosion, there's a singularity, and all matter on earth is sucked into this massive singularity.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[29:03]** And we project off of the rotting corpse of planet Earth to terraform Mars. And then, we hold a career retrospective. So that was my first blockchain art project.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[29:22]** I started working on that, and I started working on this other project called Normcorp, which was basically this idea of an art object as a startup. I’m looking at all these kind of smarmy crypto art startups, and I'm like - they're basically like art objects in and of themselves. And I was thinking about DAOs and stuff, and this was another conceptual art project.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[29:46]** But the idea behind both of these works is that they were basically scaffolding on the Distributed Art Object Framework. And so now I'll just talk a little bit about the Distributed Art Object Framework before I start launching back into some of the conceptual art ideas. Ideas that I tried scaffolding on top of it, towards this concept of distributed art.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[30:11]** The Distributed Art Object Framework was initiated with Benton in 2016. And then, what happened was, in 2018 I was at NYU for a month. I was at this thing called ITP Camp, which is basically a creative technology unconference that they hold every summer at ITP. And these guys come in one day and they're like these weird older dudes and it turns out they were these like, OG, distributed systems, blockchain experts who have been doing this stuff like since before I was born.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[30:47]** And there was like a couple of different; there was like three or four of them and they were kind of all in these overlapping collectives and projects. And so I start rapping with them and they invite me into their collectives. So there was a couple of groups: the primary one was called CoLab, and this was an offshoot of the RChain Cooperative Blockchain.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[31:11]** They were all sort of developing technologies and concepts tangential to the development of RChain. And then there was also the Digital Life Collective, which was based in the UK, but had this kind of international crew of systems theorists and designers and UX experts and people that were interested in digital identity and cooperatives. So they were also working on a bunch of really cool, interesting stuff.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[31:40]** And so I started a blockchain research group with the CoLab. And there was maybe five or so regular members who were these older dudes who have all been, you know, just working with distributed systems and online cooperation and communities they just deeply deep knowledge. And so we started taking some of the ideas, that Benton and I have been talking about, and updating them basically; we were looking at different protocols, different technologies that were emerging at the time.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[32:17]** So how do we translate a smart contract for what's something that's called object capabilities, which was the primary computational framework that they were using on our chain, which is a little bit of a different concept than like what a normal blockchain would be using to create objects. My understanding of it is: you modify JavaScript to create a persistence layer, which allows for you to create these cryptographic objects that don't really need a blockchain to instantiate themselves.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[32:54]** And, you know, at the time, what they were saying was: “oh, well, we have this special form of calculus, which is how our chain operates, which allows for us to, in theory, scale and create infinite amounts of shards”. It was proof of stake consensus in the beginning,

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[33:16]** and they could basically scale up to visa level transactions. And so we started talking about this and object capabilities and different hashing protocols and how do we deal with digital identity and how do we deal with wallets and how do we encode the artist's reserved rights and transfer sale agreement into this technological framework? And so we have this extensive conversation,

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[33:43]** and now I had taken a year off from my MFA, and so I meet these guys the summer right before I'm going back. So now I'm meeting, I have this development crew that I've been working with and working with all these ideas. But I'm also now back in an art program. So I've just had my head in this Heavy-Duty engineering space, where we're talking about this.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[34:06]** But I now have to demonstrate what I'm doing, in order to get a degree as an artist. And so now I have to work to sort of tie these ideas into the art historical canon and talk about things like systems art, conceptual art, and make projects out of it, otherwise, they would look at what my work is and say: “Oh, that may or may not be art,

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[34:28]** we don't necessarily understand this.” So what this is, it's a point where we were actually much further ahead in the conversation. But in order to create the conceptual scaffolding, for things like Normcorp or the Distributed Art Object, or the Katamari piece, I had to have a model in place that says  here's a barebones example of what this is here are.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[34:54]** the pieces that we need in order to start thinking about a distributed object. Not even as an art object, but just like this is what this is, as a technological and legal stack. This wasn't the most current or up to date or advanced model that I had, but it was at the point that I had to say: “Okay, I need to stop because I need to actually show my thinking process.”

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[35:20]** So we have four areas which were basically: “How do we define the artwork?”; “What's the certificate of authenticity?”; “Where is this stored?” - is there a unique instance of this stored and decentralized storage; is there a rights management structure that is flexible enough and incodeable to protect the rights of artists and allow for them to interact with preexisting structures?

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[35:47]** And then how do you deal with ownership transference? And, as you can see, we're using an ERC we were looking at the time at ERC-1155 so there was like an NFT component to this, but that wasn't actually the primary point. Like we were using things like file hashing, which was connected to DID - distributed identifiers. And that this was all been encoded into the NFT,

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[36:13]** but the point wasn't the actual NFT it was the artwork definition, which then all references the unique instance of the file. So we're saying in this instance that the file is the artwork. This file, in the case of this art contract, is the thing that's being identified as the artwork. So it's not about the actual NFT, it's not about the file, it's the actual stipulation of the contract that says “this file, hashed in this location, is the thing.”

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[36:48]** You can copy it, you can download it, you can rehash it again, it doesn't matter because this is the thing. And so, I started thinking about this concept of re-materialization where like this ephemeral digital object becomes the thing itself, and any way in which we materialize that, in the real world, becomes the re-materialization of it.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[37:13]** But the actual thing is the digital set of instructions. So think “I've got a 3D file located in this location.'' That's the art object. I can print as many of these as I want, but it doesn't matter because the actual art is the idea and it's a file on the set of instructions for how to execute.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[37:33]** The Distributed Art Object Framework was a technological or technical and legal stack which gives rise to emergent forms of property. So in the sense like, we've established what this thing is, what the sort of components are that we need it's almost like: all the lenses that are holographic projecting this one thing in time and space.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[37:53]** Okay. But that's great. However, my criticism was that we're not actually using this very imaginatively. We're basically using this to reinforce preexisting ownership structures and property relations. And so this is where like my kind of critical theory and political economy brain kicks in and says: “Oh, why don't we just throw that all out and imagine totally different structures and ways of relating to each other that forms a type of economy?”

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[38:23]** So I spend a lot of time trying to think about this. I don't know that I came up with any solutions, and there's people much smarter than me trying to figure this out, in large groups like, let's say, the Economic Space Agency, who I don't know if they figured it out either, but like they're much further ahead.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[38:38]** I basically was like, all right, the best I can do is try and make small experiments that would re-imagine small forms of sociality as a relational art object. It's based on this. It's based on the Distributed Art Object Framework. And here I have sort of zoomed in diagrams: defining an artwork; what a blockchain is, just to have a definition of it.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[39:04]** Here is the certificate of authenticity, and what it is; here is what an ERC token, and what we're looking to do with it is; here is a hashing protocol, this is why we need to use this; here's a rights management structure, and like how it relates to traditional art contracts form of ownership; this is a smart contract,

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[39:26]** it's just a definition, I guess, of what a smart contract is how we'd be using it; and distributed storage and unique instances on distributed storage. And so then I have like sort of like a longer text that explains what this thing is like. But, basically, my interest in this was how do we use this to then be in dialog with some of the systems and conceptual art projects that were in the earlier 20th century, update them and just start reimagining how economy and sociality work. Does that make sense?

**James McGirk:**

**[39:58]** Yeah, absolutely. And so how does Norm Corp kind of fit into this like where does that fit into all of this?

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[40:07]** So the idea is that, all right, so we can addition an art object, right? That art object can really be anything. And so I'm saying to myself, why don't I just create a relational structure that is an art object? So I'm like, well, all right. So rather than starting an art project, why don't I launch a startup and have the Lean Startup methodology become a performative score?

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[40:32]** For performing the value of this totally empty object? Because I was looking at, like, the startup scene and the theatrics and the public relations theater surrounding that. I'm like, oh, this is fascinating. None of these people have anything. They have nothing. But they're performing the value of it using these methodologies, and they just infinitely accrue value. So why don't we just try that?

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[40:55]** So I started researching monochromes in Art History, which are basically traditionally paintings or even sculptures let's say, that have no content. They're just a single color. Right? And there's this really interesting concept when you get into it that like, okay, so throughout history, I mean, dating back, I mean, at least in the Middle Ages, as far as I'm aware, there have been monochromatic paintings, and yet they mean radically different things.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[41:23]** And that's because the concept of a monochrome is that it's reflective of the larger societal context in which it exists. So if I am a agnostic mystic in Middle Ages Europe and I make like a monochromatic painting that means one thing, if I'm a Russian constructivist, it means something very different. Right? And so I started thinking about like we value, value.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[41:50]** We're starting to start up. We value, value. The entire structure of this thing is totally self-reflexive in content lists, except for the legality and the performativity of the value itself. So here I have three charts where this is the Lean Startup strategy control, but it's basically we have ideas and intent. We create a minimum viable product, and then we do a SWOT analysis, do a bunch of pivoting, and then we kind of it's very cabalistic looking, and then we kind of ascend the conceptual development until we reach marketplace saturation.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[42:31]** So then I have a diagram here called Build, Measure ,Learn, where we take a leap of faith and assumption, and we build and purify our model through the minimum viable product and then by measuring customer behavior, we use innovation accounting to learn. And then we have learning milestones, and growth hypotheses and then we are able to assert a value hypothesis.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[43:02]** And then we rinse and repeat this process over and over again, which leads to our exit strategy. Where through the wisdom of the five why’s, whether we understand, we come to understand our engine of growth. Are we viral, sticky or paid? And then we find our product market fit, which allows for us to ascend the projection through seed capital and series funding right up until our exit strategy.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[43:30]** And so part of this work was I created a laser that was projecting on a ceiling of the exhibition that was projecting the words exit strategy and the exit strategy was this idea of the art object reaching the conservation of its purpose. It sort of reaches the stage where it becomes released from the boundaries of having any type of objecthood at all right, which is very similar to like this the trajectory of a startup where it sort of start.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[43:57]** There's all this process and all these things they have to do, but eventually it gets just released into a larger pool of capital. In a sense, so to speak. So, you know, and then so then I created a white paper. It's basically it's an empty it's a it's a my my concept statement for Normcorp, which is it's a web page and it's got a little piece of code in it that allows for just it just continuously scrolls.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[44:28]** Like it just keeps adding more and more of itself until if you just keep scrolling. At a certain point, you'll see the little scrolling thing on the right hand of the screen just keeps going up and up and it keeps adding more of itself. Eventually your browser will just be crashed by the profundity of the pure emptiness, you know, and that's like that's the concept for the statement for Normcorp, it's our white paper.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[44:53]** So again, like this kind of just lived as a speculative project. I never wound up like really showing up and like to start up conventions, like performing that role. This just sort of existed as a thought experiment ultimately. But again, it's based, it's built on the scaffolding of the distributed art object framework.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[45:19]** Another project, which also is kind of living as a speculative vibe, is post capitalist karaoke, where I try to create these like karaoke songs, like my favorite Cher song, True Believer. Yeah. It's like, Cher song. 

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[45:37]** Do you believe in life after love? I built this like I made this animation of like a hyper object floating an infinite horizon and I change the word love to capitalism, right? And so it's like, do you believe in life after capitalism?  I don't think that I am strong enough, no. And so, the idea behind these were like the audience, again, I'm dealing with, like, kind of this, this notion of fractional ownership and collectivity.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[46:07]** And can I create, like, sort of micro economies that have these bizarre, gamified rule sets that sort of institute weird behaviors that sort of becomes part of the sculpture. So in order to, like, earn your share of the artwork. So to speak, you have to sing the post capitalist anthem, right? And you record the video on decentralized storage.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[46:32]** And then you're issued, I guess, shares of the artwork for participating in it. So it's like that. But then each one of these videos has some type of something. And so I was trying to figure this out and ultimately I was working with some members of the Economic Space Agency for a while trying to figure this out, but we never really came up with an actual model that we could use to really create these like sort of bizarre relational structures.** **So again, this kind of still lives.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[47:01]** As a speculative artwork that maybe, maybe I'll complete at some point, but I don't really. Part of the issue is that we don't really understand what post capitalism is. And so it's like that. What's his name? Oh, my gosh. My brain is just not working this morning. Who is this famous theorist who writes that  we simply can't imagine beyond capitalism?

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[47:28]** And like, our imagination is limited. And so, you know, we have accelerationist that are saying, well, let's just intensify everything until capitalism implodes and we all die and maybe there will be no more capitalism, and we go. Cool, bro. That's great. You know, I guess the last piece of this was a Dungeon Master, which I'm not really going to get into here because that's like a whole other ongoing project which is sort of, you know, taking this character and sort of talking about sort of more of the critical issues surrounding the blockchain.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[47:59]** So we created an academic speed metal PowerPoint album called Fear and Trembling on the Blockchain. And in order to hear our music, you have to download PowerPoint actually view the PowerPoint lecture. And so, we released that in 2020. And now we're working on a new set of content dealing with issues related to blockchain and political economy and sort of social criticism things like that.

**James McGirk:**

**[48:25]** Yes, I guess so. You know, I don't want to take too much of your time, but, you know, would you like to talk a little bit about some of your work with political economies? And kind of like what you know, what you think some of the you know, how might Web3 kind of change the relationship with, you know, with artists in the broader marketplace or how, you know, artists might change the broader marketplace?

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[48:50]** Yeah. I mean, well, there's a couple of answers that I could give to that. But I think, you know, look, when I was doing all this work back in 2017 through like 2020. I really strongly believed that there's a history in modern art, electronic art of artists intervening in emerging communications systems to try to imagine alternate realities.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[49:22]** It was like about creating alternate imaginaries, right? And so the history of video art and net art, right? Was all about like saying wow, this really powerful emergent technological communication structure is coming, and we see lots of problems in it. So, let's work together to imagine how this can be used to serve democracy and serve to tell other people's stories that are not part of the mainstream narrative.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[49:54] ** So you saw community video groups popping up in New York, all over the country that would go and do man on the street interviews. And so if you if like certain groups of people in New York City were being, you policed or beaten up in the streets or, you know, they would try and tell those stories because that wasn't being shown on the 7:00 news.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[50:21]** And the same thing with net hour. It was like, okay, let's take this thing, this Wild West and do some really out there, really imaginative stuff with that. And so I consider myself a part of that tradition. And it's critical, it's imaginative, it's playful. But fundamentally, we're engaging as artists with this to try and reimagine what this could be.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[50:44]** I have to say that at this point it's March 31st 2022. I have not seen any of my peers doing that with the blockchain. And so it's, it's, it's a great disappointment because I was really hoping at the point that all of this started taking off, we would start seeing some really imaginative stuff coming out of people. But what seems to have happened is because the nature of the technology is inherently financial and it's, it serves as a type of financialization that mechanisms supersedes all alternate possibilities, because everyone that I know kind of jumped on it and they're like, oh my gosh, I can make money now.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[51:29]** And like that that end sort of superseded any form of criticality that could have existed. It was just like, Oh, let me just cash out. I've been doing this for so long with no recognition. I want my I want mine now. Right? And so I think my biggest disappointment is that I'm really just not seeing anyone really, interrogating this in a way that I think serves the higher aims of what art could do and how art could serve as a mirror versus society.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[52:06]** I just see everyone giving in to this. So if I'm to answer your question truthfully, I don't see Web3 as having a positive effect on culture at this point or art that could change with the right group of people that are really doing radically new things. But I think it's going to take a sort of a reset or in order for that to get kicked off And so I you know, I've kind of taken a little bit of a backseat, especially in the last 18 months when this kind of this during this whole bull market run and you know, a lot of the once I started seeing all of this stuff go really mainstream.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[52:51]** All the super smart, super informed, super passionate people that I've known for the last five or six years, their voices kind of got drowned out by a lot of these very loud people who their primary objective is just being in the spotlight all the time. And so the conversation has really shifted in a very unproductive and very just not useful direction from my perspective.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[53:15]** And so I've kind of taken a little bit of a break from engaging with it publicly because I don't see it as being beneficial right now. Is that is sort of what you're going for?

**James McGirk:**

**[53:31]** Yeah. I mean, what do you think? Like, you know, give me a utopian vision of how, you know, let's say that the financial incentives,, people get, they rake in enough money and then people kind of shift their focus? What would my good Web3 art look like? If the serious kind of artists kind of start paying attention to this, what would it look like?

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[53:55]** Well, I think you have to deal with the nature of the system itself, right? So fundamentally, we're talking about what is the material structure of the system? What are the fundamental kind of ideological and coatings that are exist within that system? And can we sort of can we start twisting them? Can we sculpt them? Can we create something unexpected out of that?

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[54:16]** Can we glitch the system? Can we apply methodologies to this that breaks it? A lot of electronic art is about breaking communication infrastructure. Because it's that breakage is that slippage in which allows new things to emerge I'm seeing people calling themselves Glitch artists posting NFT’s. That's not a glitch in the system at all.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[54:42]** And so you know, people encoding types of economies that aren't cumulative and that are thinking really deeply about alternate behavior modalities. Which is again, and this is really difficult because like we almost don't know what that could be anymore. I mean, we have concepts of like the gift economy, or like barter,  or exchange, different forms of exchange.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[55:08]** We have time banking. We have local currencies that exist and like we can study these concepts. But fundamentally, it seems that the everything gets superseded by just the baseline ideology of how Bitcoin or Ethereum works, you know, and that it fundamentally turns everything that touches it into a commodified asset. And so from my perspective, you know, if you read the critical theorists from the 1930’s who were fleeing fascism and they were sort of very weary of mass culture and they were talking a lot about like, okay, the time like this is how radio commodifies culture and like this is how this becomes a tool of the state and of corporations for mass control and to make us more willing subjects of the market will like this is like a pure crystal crystallization of that, right?

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[56:05]** This is like every single thing that touches the blockchain immediately just becomes a hard, speculative asset and is immediately then rocketed into a secondary speculation market. I think fundamentally we have to. Yeah, I think this is actually my primary point here is that I think we're going to have a real conversation about what the potentiality for Web3 is.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[56:28]** It cannot under any circumstance be attached to a secondary speculation market. You cannot start a commune and a casino at the same time. And I'm going to repeat that you cannot start a commune and a casino at the same time. There's mutually incompatible things. And so we need to be willing to completely negate the spec of the secondary market and create contractual mediation that makes it so our work cannot become a speculative asset on the secondary market immediately.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[57:02]** Once you see artists willing to do that, then I start thinking, I start thinking, I think I start thinking that maybe more interesting things will happen.

**James McGirk:**

**[57:09]** Yeah, no, it makes sense. I mean, it's just because it's so... just the money just kind of overwhelms things and just eats things up. And you see that in any kind of Web3 space, it seems like it just gets swamped with money and, kind of hallows everything else out. So, thank you so much for talking to us today.

**James McGirk:**

**[57:29]** And we're can we find your work? How can we find more about what you're doing and what you'd like to do?

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[57:35]** Well, you know, I have a proposal. Great. Ericbarrydrasin.com l I'm not I'm not really on social media so much these days. I deleted my Facebook and Instagram accounts. So my work is not in either of those places. And I'm sort of on Twitter a little bit, but not really so much on the primary creative project I'm working on is called Dungeon Master, and there is an Instagram for Dungeon Master and there's a website for Dungeon Master.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[58:06]** So we're on Instagram, Twitter, Bandcamp, maybe some other platforms at some point soon. But yeah, we're getting ready to release a new project this spring. Really excited about it. It's a critical blockchain project that kind of takes aim at a lot of these sort of underlying tendencies that I'm talking about. So we're releasing a series of new albums and new content.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[58:33]** Relative to that, we're launching a cryptocurrency called Dungeon Coin that may or may not exist. And so yeah, DungeonMasterLLC [dot]com, Dungeon Master LLC on Instagram, I think would be the primary places to find that stuff.

**James McGirk:**

**[58:49]** Well, yeah. Thank you so much for doing this. And yeah, I hope we can do it again.

**Eric Barry Drasin:**

**[58:56]** Yeah, man, totally. I appreciate you. You know, inviting me on to have this conversation it’s been fun.

**James McGirk:**

**[59:00]** Yeah, totally.
